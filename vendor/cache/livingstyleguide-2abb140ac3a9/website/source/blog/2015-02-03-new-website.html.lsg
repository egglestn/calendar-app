title: New version, new site!
---

Since the LivingStyleGuide is getting a v2, we decided to give LSG a fresh, new website. It’ll be easier to organize information on the v2, as well as having more styling options than in a GitHub readme.

Most notably, this redesign features a blog – with [@anomiseditrix](https://twitter.com/anomiseditrix) as contributor – and we’ll be including full documentation and examples for LSG.

[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/LSGorg) for updates on LivingStyleGuide v2 releases!
